## Week 1 - Tech Setup

Hi everyone! This week is all about getting the environment set up. The videos below will show you how to create the accounts and download the software you'll need throughout this semester. If you run into any problems just ask for help in Slack.

Git Basics: <http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control>

You should watch this video to get an idea of why Git was created and what it is used for in everyday practice. There are _many_ resources about Git on the web if you want to learn more, but we will only be using it to send assignment files back and forth in this course so you don't have to worry about most of its functionality. Git is definitely a good thing to know, though!

Try GitHub: <https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1>

In the videos I showed you how to install the Git desktop client so you shouldn't have to actually use the command line interface much (or at all, with luck). However, if you want a little more of an introduction to what Git is actually doing I'd suggest running through this tutorial. It will show you the commands that the desktop client is actually running behind the scenes and give you another example of the concepts that Git uses.

**Assignment**

Install the software in the videos and create your GitHub account. Then, fork the <http://github.com/novomancy/dig540> repository. Once the fork is created, send me the link to your fork as a direct message in Slack. Clone your fork onto your local computer and add a helloworld.txt file to the 001 directory (like I did in the video), then sync it back to GitHub. The end result should be that your fork will have one more file than the master.

**The assignment should be done by Wednesday Sept. 9th.**
